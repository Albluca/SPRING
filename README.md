# SPRING

SPRING is a tool for exploring topological relationships in single-cell sequencing data that relies on interactive visualization of a force-directed graph. In the SPRING graph, each node is a cell and each edge is an instance of proximity in gene expression space. Users ca upload their own expression data to SPRING using our webserver https://kleintools.hms.harvard.edu/tools/spring.html

However, heavy users are encouraged to create a local installation of SPRING by following these steps:
